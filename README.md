# Polarizing-vectors

This code contains two Mathematica notebooks to find the polarizing opinion vectors with the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamic model given the social graph and the nodesâ€™ susceptibility. 


Please refer to the paper "Biondi, E., Boldrini, C., Passarella, A., & Conti, M. (2023). Dynamics of opinion polarization. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems" for further details.

The notebooks have to be saved in the same folder. The main code is Polarizing vectors.nb in which users have to declare the path of the folder in which the notebooks are. It returns the polarizing vectors and the table of the polarization values calculated on them.
